#Bubble Sort
This is the simplest sorting algorithm. It consist of passing many times over the array by swapping an element with it adjacent if the adjacent is bigger (or smaller) than the actual element.

#Selection sort
This is about finding the minimum/maximum element in the array and put it at the head. Then reduce the size of the array by 1 (Because the added element won' t be touched anymore) and repeat the process.

#Quick sort
Recursive sorting based on divide and conquer approach. More details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort
